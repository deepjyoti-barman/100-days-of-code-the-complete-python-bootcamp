""" Program to demonstrate variable naming conventions in Python """

# Rule-1: We should give such names to variables that makes the code readable.
fruit = 'apple'

# Rule-2: If there are multiple words in the name of your variable then you must separate them by putting an underscore '_' in between them. But, you can't have a space in between.
user_name = 'Deepjyoti'

# Rule_3: You can use numbers in the name of your variables. But, they can't be used at the beginning of a variable name.
# 1length = 14;         # Incorrect
length1 = 14;           # Correct

# Rule_4: It's a good practice not to give keywords and pre-defined function names to declare variables in Python
# input = input('What is your age?')      # Incorrect / Bad practice

# Rule_5: Once a variable name is decided and used, you can't change it at a later point in the code
